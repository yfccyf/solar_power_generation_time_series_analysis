# Solar Power Generation Prediction for Grid Management: Project Overview
* Created a model that predicts the next-day power generation to help power plant with grid management
* Aggregated power generation data from 22 unique inverters
* Downsampled the high-frequency data to appropriate frequency for modeling and prediciton purpose
* Performed differencing to stabilize the non-stationary time series data
* Built a VAR model in order to develop multivariate time series analysis
